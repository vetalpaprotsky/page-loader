## Installation
Page Loader can be installed using pip. The package is published on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) repository(not [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), as usually) so, you need to pass additional parameters to `pip install` command to make pip search for the package on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) instead of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Note that the name of the package is actually vetalpaprotsky-page-loader. Here's the installation command:

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ vetalpaprotsky-page-loader
```
`
To verify that the installation was successful, run `page-loader -h` command in the terminal. If you're not getting any errors, then everything went well.

Here's how the installation process looks like:
